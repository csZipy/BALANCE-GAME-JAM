alright robert that's all i've got done. i know the scope is pretty big for a 3 day game jam lol, sorry about that, i'm just having a lot of fun making this game. honestly, you can just add whatever you want and if you want to leave it unfinished then that's fine and you can just send it back to me with enough time to finish it up by Sunday at 5\:00
Directions for development from here\:\
-Fill in missing textures (homeless man, plate items, possibly shopping icons for foods)\
-Add game over logic (just switch to a game over screen or smth)\
-New dialogue for more days, total # of days can be whatever we can get done in time\
-If you last through all days without either wellbeings reaching 0, and you can afford the bills, you win (yippie!!!)
All that is just my vision for how the rest of development will go but you do you and just do whatever you want with the game honestly. It's pretty narrative heavy but it's gonna be great as long as it stays as a story about poverty and the terrible reality that comes with balancing your children's needs along with your own and your monetary needs, especially as a single mother.
