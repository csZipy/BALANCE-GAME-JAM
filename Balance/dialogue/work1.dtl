Time to work! You're a waitress at this restaurant. You have to deliver food items to the tables without dropping any of them.
Use the arrow keys to move your plate left and right. Deliver as many items as you can before your shift is over and earn $1 per item delivered.
You will lose $1 for each item dropped. Make sure to keep your balance and don't bite off more than you can chew. Click "OK" when you're ready to start.
